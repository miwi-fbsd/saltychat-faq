## Installation of Salty Chat is corrupt

If you have the following error, follow the steps below:

![Installation of Salty Chat is corrupt](https://github.com/Hanashi/saltychat-faq/raw/main/images/installationCorrupt.png)

Install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable:
- x86: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe
- x64: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

If this does not help, follow the steps below:

1. Unzip the plugin.
2. Copy the unzipped files.
3. Go to `%appdata%\TS3Client\plugins` and paste the files.

This is explained in more detail in the chapter [*.ts3_plugin is unknown file](#ts3_plugin-is-unknown-file).

## *.ts3_plugin is unknown file

If you can't open the `*.ts3_plugin` file with double click, follow the steps below:

1. Go to `C:\Program Files\TeamSpeak 3 Client` (or where you TeamSpeak is installed).
2. Run `createfileassoc.exe` as administrator.

If this does not help, follow the steps below:

1. Close TeamSpeak.
2. Download the plugin.
3. Unzip the `*.ts3_plugin` (e.g. with 7-Zip or WinRaR)
4. Go to the extracted directory. There should be a directory named `plugin`.
5. Copy the content of the directory `plugin`.
6. Go to %appdata%\TS3Client\plugins. Paste the copied files.
7. Start TeamSpeak. If the plugin is not enabled you can enable it in the options of your teamspeak.

## FiveM: Connection Timeout

In FiveM websocket connections to `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` are blocked. So we had to use a workaround. Make sure that you can resolve `lh.saltmine.de`. Follw the steps below:

1. Open Windows Command Prompt by searching `cmd`
2. Execute `nslookup lh.saltmine.de`

If it resolved to `127.0.0.1`, follow the steps in chapter [How to enable extensive debug?](#how-to-enable-extensive-debug) and send us the newest log (you can find it under `%appdata%\TS3Client\logs`) in Salty Chat Discord. If it not resolved to `127.0.0.1`, try to use a alternative DNS server (e.g. Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS).

- Google DNS server: https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#addresses
- Cloudflare DNS server: https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1/windows
- How to setup DNS server on Windows 10: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/changing-your-dns-settings-on-windows-10/

Note: If you have an IPv6 address, keep in mind to also change the DNS server for IPv6.

## FiveM: I don't hear people ingame

Check if OneSync is enabled on your server. If this does not help, follow the steps in chapter [How to enable extensive debug?](#how-to-enable-extensive-debug) and send us the newest log (you can find it under `%appdata%\TS3Client\logs`) in Salty Chat Discord.
